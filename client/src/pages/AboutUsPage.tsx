          <p >
            We acknowledge the Gadigal clan of the Eora Nation as the traditional custodians of this land. Sovereignty was never ceded. It always was and always will be, Aboriginal land. We pay our deep respects to Elders past, present and emerging. We support the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the need for a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Australian Constitution. We support reconciliation and remediation of the injustices of our colonial history. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We acknowledge the rights of every LGBQTI person to live without fear and violence. We support non-binary genders.
          </p>
          <p>
            We deplore the hunting of animals, and the breeding of animals in captivity for slaughter. We respect the rights of animals to live peacefully without fear for the duration of their natural lives.
